## The Zerdardian Website. Coded by Zerdardian | Kjeld Jense
This is the Zerdardian website coded by me. Its probably broken but you know what, lets see what it becomes.
# How to use?
Just don't. Not Right now... But if you prefer.
With this project, I have given a .env.example file. You can see a lot of things inside. Like Riot Api or the Database. At least fill in the Database because you are going to need it! After you filled in the nessesary items, remove the .example and let the site do the rest! You can than create your own site.
